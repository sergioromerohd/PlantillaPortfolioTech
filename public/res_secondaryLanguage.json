The admin profile allows content management, offering functions to add new films as well as edit or delete existing ones. On the other hand, the user profile, which is accessed via registration, allows users to explore films by categories and other criteria selected through buttons. It also includes a search feature to facilitate navigation and title searches. The entire project was developed using Svelte, a new language for me, which I had the opportunity to learn and apply in this project.",
